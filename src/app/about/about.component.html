        <h1 class="sub-title">About 12 Dog Breeds</h1>
        <p class="description">Of the hundreds of dog breeds globally, there are at least 12 breeds that exclusively sport white coats. Many types of breeds can have white pups—among many other color combinations—but a dozen canines only come in white.<br><br>
            While many of these dogs are small companion dogs, a few are strong, powerful large breeds. Some of the dogs have snowy white coats that match their Arctic or mountain environments, such as the Samoyed, Great Pyrenees, and Japanese spitz. Most of the others are showy lapdogs that served kings and nobles as companions.<br><br>

            Here are 12 exclusively white dog breeds.<br><br>
            <b>01
            Samoyed:</b><br><br>
            A regal-looking white spitz breed, the Samoyed is a medium-to-large dog that is white from head to toe. The thick, fluffy nature of the coat makes perfect sense when considering that this dog breed originated in Siberia. The indigenous Samoyed people used these strong and cold-weather tolerant dogs to herd reindeer, pull sleds, and hunt. The Samoyed has a tail that curls up over its back and a thick ruff of fur around its neck. Though these dogs are generally an all-white breed, some mature into a cream or biscuit-colored coat. Life with this white dog breed means a flurry of fur year-round. While these dogs shed their undercoat seasonally, white hair is likely to be found on your clothes and furniture year-round.<br><br>
        <b>02
            Maltese:</b><br><br>
            The smallest white dog breed is the Maltese. These pocket-sized pups mature to a weight of only 4 to 7 pounds and stay under 10 inches tall. The long and silky white coat of the Maltese adds to the cuteness of this famous companion dog, though some owners opt to keep it clipped short. Expect to invest some time in brushing your dog each week and taking regular trips to the groomer. The black button eyes and nose of the Maltese seem to peek out from behind the pure white hair, and many Maltese dogs sport a top knot or bow to keep the hair out of their eyes.<br><br>
        <b>03
            West Highland White Terrier:</b><br><br>
            The West Highland white terrier sports a double coat of white fur. The Westie, as this white dog breed is commonly referred to, is a compact but sturdy terrier from Scotland. Originally bred to hunt vermin, the white coat of this dog breed served to help the dog stand out while out hunting. The Westie is primarily a companion dog and is intelligent and playful. To keep the white coat looking its best, it needs consistent brushing each week and regular visits to the groomer every four to six weeks.<br><br><b>04
                American Eskimo:</b><br><br>
                Like a little snowman, the American Eskimo is a pure white dog breed with coal-black eyes and nose. These dogs come in standard, miniature, and toy sizes. Regardless of the size, it has a fluffy white coat and alert expression. The breed is known for being highly intelligent and was famous for performing as a circus dog in the early 1900s.

                Contrary to its name, the Eskie developed in the midwestern United States at the end of the 19th century. It used to be known as the German Spitz, was selectively bred to be snowy white, and used as a farm dog by German settlers. After World War I, the breed’s name was changed to American Eskimo. It earned AKC recognition in 1995.<br><br>
            <b>
                05
                Bichon Frise:</b><br><br>It’s easy to spot the bichon frise in a crowd of white dogs, thanks to its fluffy fur and rounded appearance. The breed as we know it today originated in France and is believed to be descended from the poodle and water spaniel. With these sporting breeds in its heritage, it’s no surprise that the bichon is an active and adventurous companion dog. Just be sure that whatever adventures you encounter with your powderpuff by your side, you provide regular brushing to avoid matting and take your dog to the groomer regularly to maintain that classic groomed appearance.<br><br>
            <b>06
                
                Great Pyrenees:</b><br><br>The largest white dog breed is the Great Pyrenees. These gentle giants can weigh 100 pounds or more and feature a thick, double coat of white fur. This type of dog likely originated in Central Asia or Siberia many millennia ago. It has since acquired its name after being brought to the Pyrenees mountains that border France and Spain.

                These dogs are known for being immensely large but also patient. They excel as herd guardians but also as loyal family companions. Living with the Great Pyrenees means preparing yourself for year-round shedding, though several brushing sessions a week will help to capture loose fur that would otherwise cling to you, your furniture, or your floors. The double coat of this dog naturally resists dirt, so only an occasional bath is needed to keep the white coat looking pure.<br><br><b>07
    
                    Coton de Tulear:</b><br><br>
                    This small white dog was formerly a jealously guarded pet to the elite of Madagascar. It’s believed that the early ancestors of these dogs were seafaring pups that kept sailors company. These small but sturdy pups make excellent companion dogs. They’re known to be good with children and other pets, too. To keep the Coton de Tulear's fur looking its best, it needs combing several times each week. Otherwise, the wispy, semi-long fur can quickly become tangled.<br><br><b>08
                        
                        Bolognese:</b><br><br>This friendly white dog breed is small with long, fluffy fur. The breed developed in the city of Bologna in northern Italy from bichons. As a result, these two white dog breeds share many similarities. However, the Bolognese has a more casual appearance when compared to the tighter curls and groomed look of the bichon. The Bolognese is known to be a calm and even shy dog breed compared to the bold, ready-to-go personality of the bichon. The semi-long fur of the Bolognese needs regular attention to keep it from becoming tangled and wild. Brushing its coat several times a week will keep mats from forming. In addition, some Bolognese owners choose to clip the dog’s coat to reduce maintenance further.<br><br><b>09
                            
                            Dogo Argentino:</b><br><br>The Dogo Argentino is one of the most powerful white dog breeds. The short, smooth coat is always white, though a single dark patch over an eye or ear is acceptable. It developed in the early 1920s to hunt large game in Argentina. These dogs have gained attention for their strength, courage, and loyalty. While they require an experienced owner, they are affectionate family dogs and generally love children. The white coat of a Dogo Argentino isn’t known to shed profusely or get smelly. They are one of the easiest white dog breeds to care for when it comes to grooming. However, beware of direct sunlight since their short, white coat makes them susceptible to sunburn.<br><br><b>10
                                
                                Japanese Spitz:</b><br><br>The daisy white Japanese spitz is a rare white dog breed. Like other spitz-type breeds, these dogs have a curled tail, a dense coat of medium length, and an alert expression. The Japanese spitz is a small-to-medium-sized dog that is very adaptable to living in spaces large or small. Despite this dog’s fluffy coat, they’re not considered heavy shedders (outside of seasonal coat shedding twice a year). Regularly brush and occasionally bathe a Japanese spitz to keep loose hair to a minimum.<br><br><b>11
                                    
                                    Komondor:</b><br><br>At a glance in an open field, you might mistake the Komondor for a fuzzy sheep. These large white dogs have long cords of fur, making them look like the sheep they were entrusted with guarding. The Komondor originated in Hungary for livestock guarding and today are one most recognizable dogs for its unique textured all-white coat.

                                    The Komondor’s coat begins to cord between eight and 12 months of age. It takes a measure of commitment to keep the cords clean and odor-free. Of course, you can’t brush the fur, but regular bathing and thorough drying (usually with a fan) are essential. The Komondor Club of America gives this advice: “The best way to keep a Komondor clean is never to allow it to get dirty.”<br><br><b>12
                                        
                                        Kuvasz:</b><br><br>Another large white dog breed, the kuvasz is a Hungarian livestock guardian. These dogs have a thick, double coat of solid white fur that helps insulate them against fluctuating temperatures. The texture varies from straight to wavy. They shed a considerable amount, so be prepared to make regular brushing part of your weekly routine. Also, expect the kuvasz to shed its coat twice a year.<br><br> </p>
